I am developing a P300-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) chess application using Python and the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) protocol. My goal is to use EEG data to detect P300 signals corresponding to specific stimuli on a chessboard GUI, allowing a user to select chessboard squares using their brain signals.

Here's a detailed summary of what has been done and the current status:

1. Implemented EEG Data Acquisition:

EEGDataAcquisition Class:

Created an EEGDataAcquisition class that runs in its own thread, handling the acquisition of EEG data and markers.
The class establishes connections to the EEG data stream and the marker stream using pylsl.StreamInlet.
EEG Data Stream:
Stream type: 'EEG'.
Connected via self.eeg_inlet.
Marker Stream:
Stream name: 'Markers'.
Connected via self.marker_inlet.
Time corrections are obtained using self.eeg_inlet.time_correction() and self.marker_inlet.time_correction().
Fake EEG Data Generator (fake_eeg_stream.py):

Using a fake EEG generator to simulate EEG data for testing purposes.
The generator outputs data at a sampling rate of 250 Hz with 19 channels.
The EEG data generator has been updated to ensure that timestamps are synchronized with LSL's local clock (pylsl.local_clock()).
Multiple methods were tried to minimize timing drift in the fake EEG generator, including using precise timing loops and adjusting sleep intervals.
2. Addressed Timing Drift Issues:

Initial Issue:

The time difference between EEG data timestamps and the local clock (pylsl.local_clock()) kept increasing over time.
This timing drift caused synchronization problems between the EEG data and marker events.
Cause Identified:

The use of time.sleep(0.01) in the data acquisition loop introduced arbitrary delays, leading to timing inconsistencies and drift.
Solution Implemented:

Removed the arbitrary time.sleep(0.01) from the run method of the EEGDataAcquisition class.
Updated the run method to maintain consistent loop timing using time.perf_counter().
Implemented a precise timing mechanism that calculates the sleep time dynamically based on the loop's execution duration.
This ensures that each iteration of the loop takes approximately the same amount of time, preventing cumulative timing drift.
After these changes, the timing drift issue was resolved:
The difference between EEG data timestamps and the local clock no longer increases over time.
Timing remains consistent throughout data acquisition.
3. Current Issue - Insufficient Epoch Samples:

Problem Description:

When attempting to extract EEG epochs around marker timestamps, the application reports that not enough EEG data is available to form a complete epoch.
Example log output:
vbnet
Copier le code
Attempting to extract EEG epoch from 18821.500738066003 to 18822.400738066
Not enough EEG data for epoch. Samples found: 10, Expected: 225
EEG buffer time range: 18811.540777828 to 18821.539454562997
Not enough EEG data for epoch.
Analysis:

The EEG buffer's time range ends just before the start of the requested epoch time window.
The buffer contains data up to approximately 18821.539 seconds.
The epoch extraction requires data starting from 18821.500 seconds.
Only 10 samples are found instead of the expected 225 samples (for an epoch length of 0.9 seconds at 250 Hz sampling rate).
This indicates that the buffer does not contain sufficient data at the required timestamps.
4. Possible Causes Identified:

Delayed Start of EEG Data Acquisition:

The EEG data acquisition may not have started early enough before the markers were received.
As a result, the EEG buffer does not have the necessary data when epoch extraction is attempted.
Time Synchronization Issues:

Despite resolving the timing drift issue, there may still be a misalignment between EEG data and marker timestamps.
The time corrections (self.eeg_time_correction and self.marker_time_correction) might not be correctly applied or sufficient.
Marker Timing:

Markers might be sent before enough EEG data has been buffered.
The application may begin the flashing sequence (which generates markers) before the EEG data acquisition thread has populated the buffer.
What I Need Help With:

Investigating the EEG Buffer Issue:

Understanding why the EEG buffer does not contain enough data at the time of the marker events.
Determining whether the EEG data acquisition thread starts early enough to populate the buffer before markers are processed.
Ensuring Proper Time Synchronization:

Verifying that the time corrections are applied correctly.
Confirming that the timestamps of EEG data and markers are properly synchronized.
Application Flow:

Reviewing the order in which the EEG data acquisition thread is started and when the flashing sequence (which generates markers) begins.
Ensuring that there is sufficient delay between starting the EEG data acquisition and beginning the flashing sequence to allow the buffer to fill.
Additional Factors:

Any other elements in the code or application logic that might prevent the EEG buffer from containing the required data for epoch extraction.
Request for Assistance:

Please help me troubleshoot and resolve this issue so that I can proceed with extracting proper EEG epochs and continue developing the P300 detection and classification components of my BCI chess application.

Please ask me for the relevant code snippets or any additional details you need to understand what has been implemented so far.

I can provide:

The updated run method of the EEGDataAcquisition class.
The get_eeg_epoch method where the epoch extraction is performed.
How and where the EEG data acquisition thread is started in relation to the marker generation (i.e., in the main application flow).
The code for the fake EEG generator (fake_eeg_stream.py) if needed.
Any other parts of the code that might be relevant to diagnosing the issue.
Your assistance in identifying the cause of the insufficient epoch samples and suggesting solutions would be greatly appreciated.
